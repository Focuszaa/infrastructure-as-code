# Automate provision AWS resources using cloudformation and Cdk

This project are having both Cloudformation template and CDK (cloud development kit) using Python.

### Cloudformation 
- Project: CfnBaseImageBuilder, Status: ðŸŸ¢ Available. cfn BaseImageBuilder Use priodically build base image for update vulnerability then use it later when build an application - the cfn provision CodePipeline with 2 stages, sources and build docker images push to ECR, there is cloudwatch event for schedule execute a pipeline as weekly, notification on codestar to notice fail/success using SNS. also having an cloudwatch event rule to execute pipeline when there is change on main branch of codecommit. 

### Cdk
